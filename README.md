## Data Cleaning
Steps undertaken to ensure high-quality data:
1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Identified missing entries in key metrics such as fare amount and trip distance.
   - Removed rows with excessive missing information when imputation was not feasible.
2. **Outlier Management:**
   - Detected outliers in metrics like trip distance and fare amount using IQR and Z-scores.
   - Capped or transformed extreme values to minimize their influence.
3. **Data Type Standardization:**
   - Ensured consistency in numerical data types (e.g., converting float to integers for counts).
   - Standardized date and time formats for temporal analyses.
4. **Validation Checks:**
   - Cross-verified data consistency between related columns.
   - Ensured no inconsistencies in key identifiers like trip IDs.
5. **Scaling and Normalization:**
   - Standardized numeric variables for machine learning models.
6. **Duplicate Removal:**
   - Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
7. **Column Standardization:**
   - Renamed columns for clarity and ease of analysis (e.g., `pickup_datetime` instead of `tpep_pickup_datetime`).
8. **Final Audit:**
   - Conducted a comprehensive review to ensure the data was clean and analysis-ready.

## Data Analysis
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Computed descriptive statistics for metrics like trip distance, fare amount, and total amount.
   - Created distribution plots to analyze data spread and identify skewness in metrics.
2. **Passenger Behavior Analysis:**
   - Analyzed the average and maximum passenger counts per trip.
   - Investigated the impact of passenger count on trip revenue.
3. **Revenue Trends:**
   - Examined temporal patterns in revenue by grouping data by time of day and day of the week.
   - Analyzed seasonal trends to determine peak revenue periods.
4. **Payment Preferences:**

   - Investigated correlations between payment type and tip amount.
5. **Outlier Insights:**
   - Identified trips with exceptionally high or low fare amounts and their characteristics.
6. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Developed machine learning models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest, to predict trip revenue.
   - Tuned hyperparameters and evaluated models using cross-validation.
7. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
   - Identified critical KPIs such as average fare amount, trip distance, and tip percentage.
   - Assessed KPIs across different passenger and payment categories.
8. **Feature Importance Analysis:**
   - Identified the most influential factors driving trip revenue using feature importance metrics.
